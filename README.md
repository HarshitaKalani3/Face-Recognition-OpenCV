# Real-time-Face-Recognition-using-OpenCV
In this python project, weâ€™ve built a real-time face recognition system using Python, OpenCV, and the LBPH recoginzer. This project is purely based on AI/ML with no use of deep learning principles.This system not only detects and recognizes known faces but also identifies unknown faces and instantly sends an email alert with their image attached.
